This project provides a partial implementation of the serial communication protocol used by VEX V5 devices. This information is derived from [PROS-CLI](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli) as well as JerryLum's reverse engineering efforts in [v5-serial-protocol](https://github.com/lemlib/v5-serial-protocol).
